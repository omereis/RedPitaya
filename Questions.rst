-----------------------------

* Is there a document available with **all** API procedures?
* In the mean time, where can I find details on ``rp_get_signals``?
* What are the meaning of the various fields in ``t_paramas`` array when calling ``rp_set_params``?
* How can I control the ADC1/2 triggers?
* Is the function ``rp_AcqGetTriggerState`` refering to the high speed input? If so, what's the different between ``rp_AcqStart`` and ``rp_get_signals``?
