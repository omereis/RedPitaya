Connect to Red Pitaya
#####################

This is the most common and recommended way of
connecting and using your Red Pitaya boards.
Your LAN network needs to have DHCP settings enabled
which is the case in majority of the local networks.
With this, simple *plug and play* approach is enabled.
Having Red Pitaya board connected the local network
will enable quick access to all Red Pitaya applications
using only your web browser.

Simply follow this 3 simple steps:

.. note:: 

    For arranging other types of connections (wireless, direct ethernet connection) use the  
    :ref:`Network manager application <networkManager>`.
       
.. note::

   ``xxxxxx`` are the last 6 characters from MAC address of your Red Pitaya board.
   MAC address is written on the Ethernet connector.
    
After the **third step** you will get a Red Pitaya main page as shown below.
